	$html .= '<h4 style="text-align: center;">AGREEMENT</h4>';

	$html .= '<ol style="padding-left: 1.2em;">
		<li><b>MPSC Rules</b> â€“ This Agreement is subject to the Michigan Public Services Commission (MPSC) Rules, including but not limited to, Rule C6.1, â€œExtension of Serviceâ€?; Rule C6.3 â€œUnderground Distribution Systemsâ€?; and Rule C6.4 â€œUnderground Service Connectionsâ€?, which are incorporated herein by reference.</li><br>

		<li><b>Underground Line Extension</b> â€“ Customer agrees to provide the following on Customerâ€™s property:  a) all necessary trenching backfilling, conduits, and manholes, and b) suitable space and necessary foundations for padmounted transformers, primary switching equipment and all other above grade equipment.</li><br>


		<li><b>Easements</b> â€“ Customer shall provide DTE Electric with a ten (10) foot wide, or wider if required by field conditions, easement for the Line Extension.</li><br>

		<li><b>Right-of-Way</b> â€“ Before DTE Electric constructs the Line Extension, Customer shall provide DTE Electric, at no cost to DTE Electric, all right-of-way and line clearance permits required for the Line Extension.  DTE Electric will assist Customer in this process by giving Customer the appropriate land ownerâ€™s names, the right-of-way forms for signatures and a sketch of the proposed Line Extension route.  If Customer cannot obtain the right-of-way, DTE Electric will extend its line on an alternate route, which may result in additional costs to Customer.  If additional costs are not paid after DTE Electric submits to Customer the costs of using an alternate route, DTE Electric may cancel this Agreement after giving the Customer five (5) days written notice.</li><br>

		<li><b>Total Payment</b> â€“ By executing this Agreement, Customer agrees to pay DTE Electric the â€œTotal Paymentâ€? calculated on the front of this agreement.  The Total payment calculation may include additional Non-Refundable costs for the services performed by DTE Electric in addition to those understood as standard services.</li><br>

			<ol type="a">
				<li><b>Standard Allowance</b> â€“ The Standard Allowance amount is calculated as follow:  two (2) times the full service credit less fuel.  This is a standard amount that DTE Electric agrees to contribute to the servicing of a customer with a five (5) year term commitment.  This amount is seen as a credit and deducted from the â€œEstimated Cost of Constructionâ€? total listed on the front page of this Agreement.</li>
				<li><b>Refundable Construction Advance</b> â€“ The Refundable Construction Advance reflects a deposit made by the Customer to construct the Line Extension, a portion of which may be refundable.  (Refer to Refunds, paragraph 6 below).</li>
				<li><b>Non-Refundable Costs</b> â€“ The Customer agrees to contribute a portion of the cost needed to construct the Line Extension.  This amount is included in the â€œEstimated Cost of Constructionâ€? total.  The â€œNon-Refundable Contributionâ€? is calculated separately and then deducted from the â€œRefundable Construction Advanceâ€?.</li>
			</ol><br>

		<li><b>Refunds</b> â€“ At the end of the first complete twelve (12) month period immediately following the date of completion of the Line Extension, DTE Electric will compute the actual revenue provided during the previous twelve (12)  months.  If the actual revenue multiplied by two (2) exceeds DTE Electricâ€™s estimated annual revenue, this amount will be refunded to the original customer.  Refunds will also be paid for additional new customers directly connected to the financed extension during the refund period and are calculated as follow:  the amount of any such refund shall be equal to two (2) times the actual annual revenue or $500 (whichever is greater) for each customer </li></ol></div>';

DTE Electric will keep any part of the Refundable Construction Advance that has not been refunded within five (5) years after completion of the Line Extension.  If this Agreement is terminated, DTE Electric will refund, without interest, all payments made by Customer under this Agreement.  DTE Electric reserves the right to obtain and apply refunds to any outstanding monies owed to the Company by same customer.</p>';

However, if DTE Electric believes that the customer will not be prepared to receive electric service on the expected construction completion date, then DTE Electric may notify Customer in writing of the postponement of the construction start date and delay when electric service will be available to Customer.  DTE Electric will begin to construct the System when all of the customers are prepared to receive electric service on the anticipated date of completion of the System construction.</li><br>

			<li><b>Termination prior to Commencement of Line Extension</b> â€“ If Customer fails to complete any obligations under this Agreement within six (6) months from the date DTE Electric receives full payment or the Total payment, then, upon written notice DTE Electric may cancel this Agreement and a refund may be issued to Customer, less all reasonable costs incurred by DTE Electric.</li><br>

			<li><b>Failure to Execute Agreement; Changes to Agreement</b> â€“ If the Customer fails to execute this Agreement and pay the Total payment due to DTE Electric within six (6) months of the date of this Agreement, then this Agreement shall become null and void.  Further, Customer shall not make any changes to this Agreement including, but not limited to, handwritten changes or striking any language.  In the event Customer makes any changes to this Agreement, without the specific written consent of DTE Electric, then this Agreement shall become null and void.</li><br>

			<li><b>Damage to System</b> â€“ If Customer, its contractors, agents, employees, successors and assigns cause damage to the System, then Customer shall reimburse DTE Electric for all costs arising out of the damage.  This includes damages caused by grade changes, which create hazards or make the facilities difficult to maintain.  DTE Electric reserves the right to retain portions of the Refundable Construction Advance to offset such damages.</li><br>

			<li><b>Assignment and Notices</b> â€“ Customer agrees not to assign this Agreement, other than the refunds of the advance,  without DTE Electricâ€™s prior written consent.  All notices required by this Agreement must be in writing and sent by U.S. mail or delivered in person to the address listed on the front page of this Agreement.</li><br>

					<li>In entering into this Agreement, DTE Electric is materially relying upon the Customer-provided estimated site aggregate monthly electrical demand in evaluating Customer&#39;s electrical service needs, eligibility for Standard Allowance amounts and responsibility for CIAC amounts. In the event that Customer&#39;s actual energy utilization is materially different than the Customer-provided estimated site aggregate monthly electrical demand then Customer agrees that Company can and will extend this Agreement for a period, determined in the sole judgment of Company, sufficient to recover the Company&#39;s distribution system design and construction costs for Customer&#39;s site, excluding Service Connection Fees.</li>
